(* if you use this function to compare two strings (returns true if the same
   string), then you avoid several of the functions in problem 1 having
   polymorphic types that may be confusing *)
fun same_string(s1 : string, s2 : string) =
    s1 = s2

(* put your solutions for problem 1 here *)

(* you may assume that Num is always used with values 2, 3, ..., 10
   though it will not really come up *)
datatype suit = Clubs | Diamonds | Hearts | Spades
datatype rank = Jack | Queen | King | Ace | Num of int 
type card = suit * rank

datatype color = Red | Black
